# Enterprise SSO Authentication

Enterprise Single Sign-On (SSO) integration enables organizations to manage Khulnasoft Cloud access through their existing identity management solution. This simplifies user authentication and improves security through centralized access control.

> **Important**: Enterprise SSO handles authentication only. User and role management must be configured separately within Khulnasoft Cloud.

2. Select User Management → Authentication & Authorization
3. Locate your desired SSO integration

**Domain Verification**:

Domain verification is required to establish secure SSO connectivity:

1. Access the DNS TXT record:
    - Go to Space Settings → User Management → Authentication & Authorization
    - Click "DNS TXT record" button to reveal verification code
2. Add DNS Record:
    - Log into your domain provider's DNS management
    - Create a new TXT record with these specifications:

      | Field                    | Value                                        |
      |--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
      | Value/Answer/Description | `"khulnasoft-verification=[VERIFICATION CODE]"` |
      | Name/Host/Alias          | Leave blank or use @ for subdomain           |
      | TTL (Time to Live)       | 86400 (or use provider default)              |

**SSO Provider Configuration**: Consult your provider's documentation for detailed instructions.

## How to Authenticate

Click on the link `Sign-in with an Enterprise Single Sign-On (SSO)` and follow the instructions. If you're not authenticated on the Enterprise SSO tool, you'll be prompted to authenticate there first before being allowed to proceed to Khulnasoft Cloud.
