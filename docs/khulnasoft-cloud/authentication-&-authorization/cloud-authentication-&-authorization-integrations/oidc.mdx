## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Authorization Server with OIDC protocol supported
- A Khulnasoft Cloud account
- Access to the Space as an **Admin**
- Space needs to be on a paid plan

### Setting up Authorization Server
Your server should follow the [full specification for OIDC](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html).
In order to integrate your Authorization Server with Khulnasoft the creation of a client is required. Clients are applications and services that can request authentication of a user.
The access settings for your client are the following:

| field                    | value                                                 |
| :--                      | :--                                                   |
| Root URL                 | `https://app.khulnasoft.com/``                           |
| Home/Initiate login URL  | `https://app.khulnasoft.com/api/v2/auth/account/auth-server?iss={your-server-issuer-url}&redirect_uri=https://app.khulnasoft.com/sign-in&register_uri=https://app.khulnasoft.com/sign-up/verify`  |
| Redirect URL             | `https://app.khulnasoft.com/api/v2/auth/account/auth-server/callback`  |

### Khulnasoft Configuration Steps
1. Click on the Space settings cog (located above your profile icon)
2. Click on the **User Management** section and access **Authentication and Authorization** tab.
3. On the OIDC card, click on **Configure**
4. Fill in the required credentials:
    - **Issuer URL** the Authorization Server Issuer URL, e.g. `https://my-auth-server.com/`
    - **Client ID** the Client ID from the created client
    - **Client Secret** the Client Secret from the created client
    - **Authorization URL** the Authorization Server authorization URL, e.g. `https://my-auth-server.com/openid-connect/auth`
    - **Token URL** the Authorization Server token URL, e.g. `https://my-auth-server.com/openid-connect/token`
    - **User URL** the Authorization Server user info URL, e.g. `https://my-auth-server.com/openid-connect/userinfo`
