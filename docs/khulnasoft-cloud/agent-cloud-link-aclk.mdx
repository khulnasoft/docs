# Agent-Cloud link (ACLK)

The Agent-Cloud Link (ACLK) provides secure communication between your Khulnasoft Agents and Cloud. This connection:

- Uses outgoing secure WebSocket (WSS) on port `443`
- Activates only after you [connect a node](/docs/khulnasoft-cloud/connect-agent-to-cloud) to your Space
- Ensures encrypted, safe data transmission

For ACLK to function properly, your Agents need outbound access to Khulnasoft Cloud services.

| Allowlisting Method | Required Access                                                            |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Domain              | • `app.khulnasoft.com`<br/>• `api.khulnasoft.com`<br/>• `mqtt.khulnasoft.com` |

> **Important**
>
> IP addresses can change without notice! Always **prefer domain allowlisting**. If you must use IP addresses, be aware that they vary based on your geographic location due to CDN-edge servers. You'll need to regularly verify the IP addresses specific to your region.

## Data privacy

Your monitoring data belongs to you. Here's how we ensure this:

- **Zero Metric Storage**: We do not store any metrics or logs in Khulnasoft Cloud.
- **Local Data Control**: All your monitoring data stays within your infrastructure.
- **Minimal Metadata**: We store only essential metadata needed for coordination and access control.

For complete transparency:

- Read our detailed [Privacy Policy](https://khulnasoft.com/privacy/)
- Docs more about [stored metadata](/docs/khulnasoft-cloud#stored-metadata)

## Enable and configure the ACLK

The Agent-Cloud Link is enabled automatically—no configuration needed.
If your Agent requires a proxy to access the internet, you'll need to [configure proxy settings](/docs/khulnasoft-cloud/connect-agent-to-cloud#automatically-via-a-provisioning-system-or-the-command-line).
