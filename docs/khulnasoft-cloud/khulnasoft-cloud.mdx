# Khulnasoft Cloud

Khulnasoft Cloud is a powerful service that transforms standalone Khulnasoft Agent installations into a unified, scalable observability solution. It achieves this without centralizing metric storage, ensuring optimal performance and cost-effectiveness even at enterprise scale.

By serving as a lightweight control plane, Khulnasoft Cloud provides:

- Seamless coordination across multiple teams and environments
- Unified visibility across cloud providers and data centers
- Real-time, high-fidelity monitoring at any scale
- Flexible observability pipelines that grow with your infrastructure

## Stored metadata

Khulnasoft Cloud doesn't store your metrics or logs.

**What Khulnasoft Cloud Does Store**:

- Node information and labels
- Metric names, labels, and retention periods
- Active collectors
- Alert configurations and state changes

**How Data Flows**:

1. Metadata (listed above) is synchronized between Agents and Cloud
2. Metric data and logs remain stored locally on your Agents
3. When you view dashboards:
    - Data is transferred directly from Agents to your browser via Cloud
    - Cloud aggregates responses from multiple Agents into a unified view
    - No metric or log data is stored in Cloud during this process

## Fidelity and Resolution

Khulnasoft Cloud delivers the exact same high-quality data that Agents collect. When you view dashboards through the Cloud:

- No reduction in metric resolution
- No loss of data fidelity
- No compromise in data granularity

The data you see is identical to what you would get by accessing Agents directly.

## FAQ

<details><summary>details</summary>

### Does the Cloud require Observability Centralization Points?

No. Any or all Agents can be connected directly to the Cloud.

We recommend creating [Observability Centralization Points](/docs/observability-centralization-points), as required for operational efficiency (ephemeral nodes, teams or services isolation, central control of alerts, production systems performance), security policies (internet isolation), or cost optimization (use existing capacities before allocating new ones).

### When I have Parents, do I need to connect the Children to the Cloud too?

No, it is not necessary, but it provides high availability.

When Parents are connected to the Cloud, all their Children are available via them.

When multiple Parents store data from the same Children (in clusters or multi-level hierarchies), the Cloud queries each unique node once through a single available Parent.

The Cloud prefers:

- The most distant (from the Child) Parent that is available when doing metrics visualization queries (since usually these Parents have been added for this purpose).

- The closest (to the Child) Parent available for [Top Monitoring](/docs/top-monitoring-khulnasoft-functions). The streaming protocol of Parents and Children is able to forward such requests to the leaf child, via the Parents, to respond with live and accurate data.

Children may be connected to the Cloud for high-availability, in cases where their Parents become unreachable.
