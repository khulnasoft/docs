# Top Monitoring (Khulnasoft Functions)

Khulnasoft Agent collectors provide on-demand, runtime executable functions on the host where they are deployed. Available since v1.37.1.

## What is a function?

Beyond their primary roles of collecting metrics, collectors can execute specific routines when requested. These routines provide additional diagnostic information or trigger actions directly on the host node.

## What functions are currently available?

## How do functions work with streaming?

When streaming is enabled, function definitions propagate from Child nodes to their Parent node. If this Parent node is connected to Khulnasoft Cloud, it can trigger function execution on any of its connected Child nodes.

## Why are some functions only available on Khulnasoft Cloud?

Some functions are exclusively available through Khulnasoft Cloud for security reasons. Since functions can execute node-level routines that may access sensitive information, we restrict their exposure through the Agent's API. This security concern is addressed by our [ACLK](/docs/khulnasoft-cloud/agent-cloud-link-aclk) protocol, which provides secure communication between Khulnasoft Agent and Khulnasoft Cloud.
