# Average or Mean

> This query is available as `average` and `mean`.

An average is a single number taken as representative of a list of numbers.

It is calculated as:

```
average = sum(numbers) / count(numbers)
```

## how to use

Use it in alerts like this:

```
 alarm: my_alert
    on: my_chart
lookup: average -1m unaligned of my_dimension
  warn: $this > 1000
```

`average` does not change the units. For example, if the chart units is `requests/sec`, the result
will be again expressed in the same units. 

It can also be used in APIs and badges as `&group=average` in the URL.
