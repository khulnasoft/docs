# Running a Local Dashboard through Cloudflare Tunnels

## Summary of tasks

- Make a `khulnasoft-web` HTTP tunnel on the parent node, so the web interface can be viewed publicly
- Make a `khulnasoft-tcp` tcp tunnel on the parent node, so it can receive tcp streams from child nodes
- Provide access to the `khulnasoft-tcp` tunnel on the child nodes, so you can send the tcp stream to the parent node
- Make sure the parent node uses port `19999` for both web and tcp streams
- Make sure that the child nodes have `mode = none` in the `[web]` section of the `khulnasoft.conf` file, and `destination = tcp:127.0.0.1:19999` in the `[stream]` section of the `stream.conf` file

## Detailed instructions with commands and service files

- Install the `cloudflared` package on all your Khulnasoft nodes, follow the repository instructions [here](https://pkg.cloudflare.com/index.html)

- Login to cloudflare with `sudo cloudflared login` on all your Khulnasoft nodes

### Parent node: public web interface and receiving stats from Child nodes

- Create the HTTP tunnel  
    `sudo cloudflared tunnel create khulnasoft-web`
- Start routing traffic  
    `sudo cloudflared tunnel route dns khulnasoft-web khulnasoft-web.my.domain`
- Create a service by making a file called `/etc/systemd/system/cf-tun-khulnasoft-web.service` and input:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=cloudflare tunnel khulnasoft-web
After=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=root
Group=root
ExecStart=/usr/bin/cloudflared --no-autoupdate tunnel run --url http://localhost:19999 khulnasoft-web
Restart=on-failure
TimeoutStartSec=0
RestartSec=5s

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

- Create the TCP tunnel  
  `sudo cloudflared tunnel create khulnasoft-tcp`
- Start routing traffic  
  `sudo cloudflared tunnel route dns khulnasoft-tcp khulnasoft-tcp.my.domain`
- Create a service by making a file called `/etc/systemd/system/cf-tun-khulnasoft-tcp.service` and input:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=cloudflare tunnel khulnasoft-tcp
After=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=root
Group=root
ExecStart=/usr/bin/cloudflared --no-autoupdate tunnel run --url tcp://localhost:19999 khulnasoft-tcp
Restart=on-failure
TimeoutStartSec=0
RestartSec=5s

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

### Child nodes: send stats to the Parent node

- Create a service by making a file called `/etc/systemd/system/cf-acs-khulnasoft-tcp.service` and input:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=cloudflare access khulnasoft-tcp
After=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=root
Group=root
ExecStart=/usr/bin/cloudflared --no-autoupdate access tcp --url localhost:19999 --tunnel-host khulnasoft-tcp.my.domain
Restart=on-failure
TimeoutStartSec=0
RestartSec=5s

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

You can edit the configuration file using the `edit-config` script from the Khulnasoft [config directory](/docs/khulnasoft-agent/configuration#the-khulnasoft-config-directory).

- Edit `khulnasoft.conf` and input:

```ini
[web]
    mode = none
```

- Edit `stream.conf` and input:

```ini
[stream]
    destination = tcp:127.0.0.1:19999
```

[Restart the Agents](/docs/khulnasoft-agent/maintenance/service-control), and you are done!

You should now be able to have a Local Dashboard that gets its metrics from Child instances, running through Cloudflare tunnels.
