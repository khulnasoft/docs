# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to Khulnasoft!

Maintaining a platform for monitoring everything requires a vast knowledge base. We rely on community contributions and user feedback to continue to provide the best monitoring solution.

There are many ways to contribute, with varying skill requirements, explained in detail in the following sections.

One good way to start is searching through [specific GitHub issues](https://github.com/khulnasoft/khulnasoft/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) we need help with. Some of them are also labeled as "good first issue".

## Give Khulnasoft a GitHub star

GitHub stars are a great way to show your appreciation for open-source projects like Khulnasoft. Starring Khulnasoft helps us in several ways:

- **Increases project discoverability**: More stars make Khulnasoft more visible to others searching for monitoring solutions on GitHub.
- **Attracts valuable contributors**: A high star count signals to developers that Khulnasoft is a thriving project worth contributing to. This can lead to more features, bug fixes, and overall project improvement.

If you enjoy using Khulnasoft, consider giving it a ðŸŒŸ!

### Contribute collectors

Khulnasoft lets you add custom data sources through collector plugins. Before diving in, check our [collector documentation](/docs/collecting-metrics) to understand how they work.

The Khulnasoft Agent has a modular approach to collecting data from data sources, meaning that we have a number of collector plugins that send data to the Khulnasoft Agent. For each collector plugin, you can create a new module which collects data from a data source.

To contribute a new collector:

- **Go**: Follow the guide [How to write a Khulnasoft collector in Go](/docs/developer-and-contributor-corner/external-plugins/go.d.plugin/how-to-write-a-khulnasoft-collector-in-go).
- **Python**: Follow the guide [How to contribute a Python collector](https://github.com/khulnasoft/khulnasoft/blob/master/docs/developer-and-contributor-corner/python-collector.md).
- **Shell/Bash**: Refer to the [charts.d documentation](/docs/developer-and-contributor-corner/external-plugins/charts.d.plugin).
- **StatsD**: Unfamiliar with StatsD? We have an [intro](https://www.khulnasoft.com/blog/introduction-to-statsd/) and [reference docs](/docs/collecting-metrics/statsd).

### Contribute alerts

Khulnasoft comes pre-configured with alerts for common monitoring needs. You can help improve these in two ways:

1. **Modify or add alerts**: Enhance existing alerts or define new ones for specific use cases.
2. **Alerts for new collectors**: If you contribute a new collector, consider including basic alerts for it.

To do both, you'll need to create or modify alert configuration files. The process is covered in the [Health Reference](/docs/alerts-&-notifications/alert-configuration-reference) documentation.

### Contribute alert notifications

Khulnasoft Agent supports sending notifications for various monitoring alerts. The Agent uses alerts to trigger notifications and then executes a script called `alarm-notify.sh`.

To modify existing notifications or create new ones, you'll need to use Bash scripting.

Here are ways to get started:

- **Copy existing notifications**: Look at the structure of already implemented notifications within `alarm-notify.sh` and adapt them for your needs.
- **Use custom endpoint as boilerplate**: Look at the [custom endpoint notification](/docs/alerts-&-notifications/notifications/agent-dispatched-notifications/custom) as a starting point for your custom notification script.
