# Notifications

This section includes the documentation of the integrations for both of Khulnasoft's notification methods.

<!-- following links are virtual links to a generated page, should not lead somewhere upon click from GitHub -->

- Khulnasoft Cloud provides centralized alert notifications, using the health status data already sent to Khulnasoft Cloud from connected nodes to send alerts to configured integrations. [Supported integrations](https://github.com/khulnasoft/khulnasoft/blob/master/docs/alerts-and-notifications/notifications/centralized-cloud-notifications) include Amazon SNS, Discord, Slack, Splunk, and others.

- The Khulnasoft Agent offers a [wider range of notification options](/docs/alerts-and-notifications/notifications/agent-dispatched-notifications) directly from the Agent itself. You can choose from over a dozen services, including email, Slack, PagerDuty, Twilio, and others, for more granular control over notifications on each node.
