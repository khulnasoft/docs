# Microsoft Teams


<img src="https://khulnasoft.com/img/msteams.svg" width="150"/>


You can send Khulnasoft alerts to Microsoft Teams using Khulnasoft's Agent alert notification feature, which supports dozens of endpoints, user roles, and more.



<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/maintained%20by-Khulnasoft-%2300ab44" />

## Setup

### Prerequisites

#### 

- The incoming webhook URL as given by Microsoft Teams. You can use the same on all your Khulnasoft servers (or you can have multiple if you like).
- One or more channels to post the messages to
- Access to the terminal where Khulnasoft Agent is running



### Configuration

#### File

The configuration file name for this integration is `health_alarm_notify.conf`.


You can edit the configuration file using the [`edit-config`](/docs/khulnasoft-agent/configuration#edit-a-configuration-file-using-edit-config) script from the
Khulnasoft [config directory](/docs/khulnasoft-agent/configuration#the-khulnasoft-config-directory).

```bash
cd /etc/khulnasoft 2>/dev/null || cd /opt/khulnasoft/etc/khulnasoft
sudo ./edit-config health_alarm_notify.conf
```
#### Options

The following options can be defined for this notification

<details open><summary>Config Options</summary>

| Name | Description | Default | Required |
|:----|:-----------|:-------|:--------:|
| SEND_MSTEAMS | Set `SEND_MSTEAMS` to YES | YES | yes |
| MSTEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL | set `MSTEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL` to the incoming webhook URL as given by Microsoft Teams. |  | yes |
| DEFAULT_RECIPIENT_MSTEAMS | Set `DEFAULT_RECIPIENT_MSTEAMS` to the encoded Microsoft Teams channel name you want the alert notifications to be sent to. |  | yes |

##### DEFAULT_RECIPIENT_MSTEAMS

In Microsoft Teams the channel name is encoded in the URI after `/IncomingWebhook/`. You can define multiple channels like this: `CHANNEL1` `CHANNEL2`.

All roles will default to this variable if left unconfigured.

You can have different channels per role, by editing `DEFAULT_RECIPIENT_MSTEAMS` with the channel you want, in the following entries at the bottom of the same file:
```text
role_recipients_msteams[sysadmin]="CHANNEL1"
role_recipients_msteams[domainadmin]="CHANNEL2"
role_recipients_msteams[dba]="databases CHANNEL3"
role_recipients_msteams[webmaster]="CHANNEL4"
role_recipients_msteams[proxyadmin]="CHANNEL5"
role_recipients_msteams[sitemgr]="CHANNEL6"
```


</details>

#### Examples

##### Basic Configuration



```yaml
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Microsoft Teams (office.com) global notification options

SEND_MSTEAMS="YES"
MSTEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL="https://outlook.office.com/webhook/XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX@XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX/IncomingWebhook/CHANNEL/XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX"
DEFAULT_RECIPIENT_MSTEAMS="XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"

```


## Troubleshooting

### Test Notification

You can run the following command by hand, to test alerts configuration:

```bash
# become user khulnasoft
sudo su -s /bin/bash khulnasoft

# enable debugging info on the console
export KHULNASOFT_ALARM_NOTIFY_DEBUG=1

# send test alarms to sysadmin
/usr/libexec/khulnasoft/plugins.d/alarm-notify.sh test

# send test alarms to any role
/usr/libexec/khulnasoft/plugins.d/alarm-notify.sh test "ROLE"
```

Note that this will test _all_ alert mechanisms for the selected role.
