# Machine Docsing and Anomaly Detection

Khulnasoft provides advanced Machine Docsing features to help you identify and troubleshoot anomalies and unexpected behavior in your infrastructure before they become critical issues:

- K-means clustering [Machine Docsing models](/docs/machine-docsing-and-anomaly-detection/ml-models-and-anomaly-detection) are trained to power the [Anomaly Advisor](/docs/dashboards-and-charts/anomaly-advisor-tab) on the dashboard, which allows you to identify Anomalies in your infrastructure.
- [Metric Correlations](/docs/machine-docsing-and-anomaly-detection/metric-correlations) are possible through the dashboard using the [Two-sample Kolmogorov Smirnov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov%E2%80%93Smirnov_test#Two-sample_Kolmogorov%E2%80%93Smirnov_test) statistical test and Volume heuristic measures.
- The [Khulnasoft Assistant](/docs/machine-docsing-and-anomaly-detection/ai-powered-troubleshooting-assistant) is able to answer your prompts when it comes to troubleshooting Alerts and Anomalies.
