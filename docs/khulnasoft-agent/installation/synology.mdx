The good news is that our
[one-line installation script](/docs/khulnasoft-agent/installation/linux)
works fine if your NAS is one that uses the amd64 architecture. It
will install the content into `/opt/khulnasoft`, making future removal safe and simple.

## Run as khulnasoft user

When Khulnasoft is first installed, it will run as _root_. This may or may not be acceptable for you, and since other
installations run it as the `khulnasoft` user, you might wish to do the same. This requires some extra work:

1. Create a group `khulnasoft` via the Synology group interface. Give it no access to anything.
2. Create a user `khulnasoft` via the Synology user interface. Give it no access to anything and a random password. Assign
    the user to the `khulnasoft` group. Khulnasoft will chuid to this user when running.
3. Change ownership of the following directories:

    ```sh
    chown -R root:khulnasoft /opt/khulnasoft/usr/share/khulnasoft
    chown -R khulnasoft:khulnasoft /opt/khulnasoft/var/lib/khulnasoft /opt/khulnasoft/var/cache/khulnasoft
    chown -R khulnasoft:root /opt/khulnasoft/var/log/khulnasoft
    ```

4. Restart Khulnasoft

    ```sh
    /etc/rc.khulnasoft restart
    ```

## Create startup script

Additionally, as of 2018/06/24, the Khulnasoft installer doesn't recognize DSM as an operating system, so no init script is
installed. You'll have to do this manually:

1. Add [this file](https://gist.github.com/oskapt/055d474d7bfef32c49469c1b53e8225f) as `/etc/rc.khulnasoft`. Make it
    executable with `chmod 0755 /etc/rc.khulnasoft`.
2. Add or edit `/etc/rc.local` and add a line calling `/etc/rc.khulnasoft` to have it start on boot:

    ```text
    # Khulnasoft startup
    [ -x /etc/rc.khulnasoft ] && /etc/rc.khulnasoft start
    ```

3. Make sure `/etc/rc.local` is executable: `chmod 0755 /etc/rc.local`.
