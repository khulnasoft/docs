# Khulnasoft Windows Installer

Khulnasoft offers a convenient Windows installer for easy setup. This executable provides two distinct installation modes, outlined below.

## Download the MSI Installer

You can download the Khulnasoft Windows installer (MSI) from the official releases page:

| Version                                                                                          | Description                                                                                                                                                               |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Stable](https://github.com/khulnasoft/khulnasoft/releases/latest/download/khulnasoft-x64.msi)            | This is the recommended version for most users as it provides the most reliable and well-tested features.                                                                 |
| [Nightly](https://github.com/khulnasoft/khulnasoft-nightlies/releases/latest/download/khulnasoft-x64.msi) | Offers the latest features but may contain bugs or instabilities. Use this option if you require access to the newest features and are comfortable with potential issues. |

> **Note**
>
> The Windows version of Khulnasoft is intended for users on paid plans.

## Silent Mode (Command line)

This section provides instructions for installing Khulnasoft in silent mode, which is ideal for automated deployments.

> **Info**
>
> Run the installer as admin to avoid the Windows prompt.
>
> Using silent mode implicitly accepts the terms of the [GPL-3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/khulnasoft/khulnasoft/refs/heads/master/LICENSE) (Khulnasoft Agent) and [NCUL1](https://app.khulnasoft.com/LICENSE.txt) (Khulnasoft Web Interface) licenses, skipping the display of agreements.

### Available Options

| Option       | Description                                                                                      |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/qn`        | Enables silent mode installation.                                                                |
| `/i`         | Specifies the path to the MSI installer file.                                                    |
| `INSECURE=1` | Forces insecure connections, bypassing hostname verification (use only if absolutely necessary). |
| `TOKEN=`     | Sets the Claim Token for your Khulnasoft Cloud Space.                                               |
| `ROOMS=`     | Comma-separated list of Room IDs where you want your node to appear.                             |
| `PROXY=`     | Sets the proxy server address if your network requires one.                                      |

### Example Usage

To connect your Agent to your Cloud Space:

```bash
msiexec /qn /i khulnasoft-x64.msi TOKEN="<YOUR_TOKEN>" ROOMS="<YOUR_ROOMS>"
```

Where:

- `<YOUR_TOKEN>`: Your Space claim token from Khulnasoft Cloud.
- `<YOUR_ROOMS>`: Your Room ID(s) from Khulnasoft Cloud.

This command downloads and installs Khulnasoft in one step:

```powershell
$ProgressPreference = 'SilentlyContinue'; Invoke-WebRequest https://github.com/khulnasoft/khulnasoft/releases/latest/download/khulnasoft-x64.msi -OutFile "khulnasoft-x64.msi"; msiexec /qn /i khulnasoft-x64.msi TOKEN=<YOUR_TOKEN> ROOMS=<YOUR_ROOMS>
```

## Graphical User Interface (GUI)

1. **Double-click** the installer to begin the setup process.
2. **Grant Administrator Privileges**: You'll need to provide administrator permissions to install the Khulnasoft service.

Once installed, you can access your Khulnasoft dashboard at `localhost:19999`.
