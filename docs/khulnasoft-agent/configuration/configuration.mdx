# Khulnasoft Agent Configuration

> **Info**
>
> Khulnasoft Cloud lets you configure Agents on the fly. Check the [Dynamic Configuration Manager](/docs/khulnasoft-agent/configuration/dynamic-configuration-manager) documentation for details.

The main Khulnasoft Agent configuration is `khulnasoft.conf`.

## The Khulnasoft config directory

On most Linux systems, the **Khulnasoft config
directory** will be `/etc/khulnasoft/`. The config directory contains several configuration files with the `.conf` extension, a
few directories, and a shell script named `edit-config`.

> Some operating systems will use `/opt/khulnasoft/etc/khulnasoft/` as the config directory. If you're not sure where yours
> is, navigate to `http://NODE:19999/khulnasoft.conf` in your browser, replacing `NODE` with the IP address or hostname of
> your node, and find the `# config directory =` setting. The value listed is the config directory for your system.

All of Khulnasoft's documentation assumes that your config directory is at `/etc/khulnasoft`, and that you're running any scripts from inside that directory.

## Edit a configuration file using `edit-config`

We recommend the use of the `edit-config` script for configuration changes.

It exists inside your config directory (read above) and helps manage and safely edit configuration files.

To edit `khulnasoft.conf`, run this on your terminal:

```bash
cd /etc/khulnasoft 2>/dev/null || cd /opt/khulnasoft/etc/khulnasoft
sudo ./edit-config khulnasoft.conf
```

Your editor will open.

## downloading `khulnasoft.conf`

The running version of `khulnasoft.conf` can be downloaded from a running Khulnasoft Agent, at this URL:

```url
http://agent-ip:19999/khulnasoft.conf
```

You can save and use this version, using these commands:

```bash
cd /etc/khulnasoft 2>/dev/null || cd /opt/khulnasoft/etc/khulnasoft
curl -ksSLo /tmp/khulnasoft.conf.new http://localhost:19999/khulnasoft.conf && sudo mv -i /tmp/khulnasoft.conf.new khulnasoft.conf 
```
