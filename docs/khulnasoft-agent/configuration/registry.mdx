# Registry Configuration Reference

Khulnasoft uses a **central Registry**. Together with certain browser features, it allows Khulnasoft to provide unified cross-server dashboards. Read more about it in the [overview page](/docs/khulnasoft-agent/registry).

The Registry operates with [minimal data transfer](/docs/khulnasoft-agent/registry#communication-with-the-registry), with all communication occurring directly between your web browser and the Registry.

## Configure a Custom Registry

Any Khulnasoft Agent can function as a Registry.

1. To set up your own Registry node, modify `khulnasoft.conf` using [`edit-config`](/docs/khulnasoft-agent/configuration#edit-a-configuration-file-using-edit-config):

   ```text
   [registry]
       enabled = yes
       registry to announce = http://your.registry:19999
   ```

2. [Restart the Agent](/docs/khulnasoft-agent/maintenance/service-control) for the changes to take effect.
3. Next, configure all other Agents to use your custom Registry instead of the default one. For each Agent, modify `khulnasoft.conf`:

   ```text
   [registry]
      enabled = no
      registry to announce = http://your.registry:19999
   ```

4. To improve node identification in your dashboard, you can assign custom names to each Agent (optional):

   ```text
   [registry]
      registry hostname = Group1 - Master DB
   ```

## Configure Registry Access Control

You can restrict Registry access to specific IP addresses or hostnames using [simple pattern](/docs/developer-and-contributor-corner/libkhulnasoft/simple-patterns) matching:

```text
[registry]
    allow from = *
```

> **Info**
>
> For example, `allow from = !10.1.2.3 10.*` allows all IPs in the `10.*` range except `10.1.2.3`.

**Access Control Considerations**

- Registry access rules work in conjunction with the main API access control (`[web].allow connections from`). IPs must be allowed by both settings to access the Registry.
- Patterns can match against IP addresses or host FQDNs. For hostname matching, the system performs both reverse and forward DNS lookups to prevent DNS spoofing.

**DNS Resolution Settings**

DNS resolution for pattern matching can impact performance on systems handling many connections. Control this behavior using:

```text
[registry]
    allow by dns = heuristic
```

Available options:

|   Option    | Description                                                                                      |
|:-----------:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|    `yes`    | Enables hostname pattern matching using DNS                                                      |
|    `no`     | Restricts patterns to match IP addresses only                                                    |
| `heuristic` | Automatically determines whether to use DNS based on pattern syntax (presence of `:` or letters) |

## Registry database location

The Registry maintains its data in two text-based database files located at `/var/lib/khulnasoft/registry/`.

| File              | Purpose                                   | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                             |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `registry-log.db` | Records all real-time Registry operations | Captures every modification to the Registry as it occurs                                                                                                                             |
| `registry.db`     | Stores the consolidated Registry data     | Updates after every `[registry].registry save db every new entries` entries in the transaction log, at which point the main database is refreshed and the transaction log is cleared |

## Configure Cookie Security Settings

By default, the Khulnasoft Agent's web server sets `SameSite=none` and `Secure` attributes for its cookies. If these security settings interfere with accessing your Agent dashboard or Khulnasoft Cloud, you can disable them.

To modify cookie settings, edit `khulnasoft.conf` using [`edit-config`](/docs/khulnasoft-agent/configuration#edit-a-configuration-file-using-edit-config):

```text
[registry]
    enable cookies SameSite and Secure = no
```

Disabling these security attributes may affect browser compatibility and security. Only disable them if you're experiencing specific access issues.

## Troubleshooting the Registry

The Registry URL must point to a valid Khulnasoft dashboard where the Registry is enabled (`[registry].enabled = yes`). You can verify your Registry configuration by accessing its URL directly in your web browserâ€”it should display the dashboard of the Khulnasoft Agent running the Registry.
The Registry relies on third-party cookies to function properly. The Registry sets these cookies while you're viewing dashboards from other Khulnasoft Agents.

When a new browser first connects, the Registry performs a cookie compatibility check through the following process:

- Set a test cookie.
- Redirect the browser back to verify the cookie.

If cookies are disabled or blocked, this process fails after several redirects with an error similar to:

```text
ERROR 409: Cannot ACCESS khulnasoft registry: https://registry.my-khulnasoft.io responded with: {"status":"redirect","registry":"https://registry.my-khulnasoft.io"}
```

To view these error messages, open your browser's developer console (typically F12).
