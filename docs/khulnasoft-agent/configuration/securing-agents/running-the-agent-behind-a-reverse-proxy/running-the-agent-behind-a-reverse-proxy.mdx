# Running the Khulnasoft Agent behind a reverse proxy

If you need to access a Khulnasoft Agent's user interface or API in a production environment, we recommend you put Khulnasoft behind
another web server and secure access to the dashboard via SSL, user authentication, and firewall rules.

A dedicated web server also provides more robustness and capabilities than the Agent's [internal web server](https://github.com/khulnasoft/khulnasoft/blob/master/src/web/README.md).

We have documented running behind
[nginx](/docs/khulnasoft-agent/configuration/securing-agents/running-the-agent-behind-a-reverse-proxy/nginx),
[Apache](/docs/khulnasoft-agent/configuration/securing-agents/running-the-agent-behind-a-reverse-proxy/apache),
[HAProxy](/docs/khulnasoft-agent/configuration/securing-agents/running-the-agent-behind-a-reverse-proxy/haproxy),
[Lighttpd](/docs/khulnasoft-agent/configuration/securing-agents/running-the-agent-behind-a-reverse-proxy/lighttpd-v1.4.x),
[Caddy](/docs/khulnasoft-agent/configuration/securing-agents/running-the-agent-behind-a-reverse-proxy/caddy),
and [H2O](/docs/khulnasoft-agent/configuration/securing-agents/running-the-agent-behind-a-reverse-proxy/h2o).
If you prefer a different web server, we suggest you follow the documentation for nginx and tell us how you did it by adding your own "Running behind webserverX" document.

When you run Khulnasoft behind a reverse proxy, we recommend you firewall protect all your Khulnasoft servers, so that only the web server IP will be allowed to directly access Khulnasoft. To do this, run this on each of your servers (or use your firewall manager):

```sh
PROXY_IP="1.2.3.4"
iptables -t filter -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 19999 \! -s ${PROXY_IP} -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -j DROP
```

The above will prevent anyone except your web server from accessing a Khulnasoft dashboard running on the host.

You can also use `khulnasoft.conf`:

```text
[web]
    allow connections from = localhost 1.2.3.4
```

Of course, you can add more IPs.
