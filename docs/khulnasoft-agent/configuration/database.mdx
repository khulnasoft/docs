# Database Configuration Reference

This document provides details on configuring the Agent's Database. For a deeper understanding of the Database components, see the [Database overview](/docs/khulnasoft-agent/database).

## Modes

Use [`edit-config`](/docs/khulnasoft-agent/configuration#edit-a-configuration-file-using-edit-config) to open `khulnasoft.conf` and set your preferred mode:

```text
[db]
  # dbengine, ram, none
  mode = dbengine
```

## Tiers

### Retention Settings

> **Important**
>
> In a Parent-Child setup, these settings manage the entire storage space used by the Parent for storing metrics collected both by itself and its Children.

You can fine-tune retention for each tier by setting a time limit or size limit. Setting a limit to 0 disables it. This enables the following retention strategies:

| Setting                        | Retention Behavior                                                                                                                       |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Size Limit = 0, Time Limit > 0 | **Time based:** data is stored for a specific duration regardless of disk usage                                                          |
| Time Limit = 0, Size Limit > 0 | **Space based:** data is stored with a disk space limit, regardless of time                                                              |
| Time Limit > 0, Size Limit > 0 | **Combined time and space limits:** data is deleted once it reaches either the time limit or the disk space limit, whichever comes first |

You can change these limits using [`edit-config`](/docs/khulnasoft-agent/configuration#edit-a-configuration-file-using-edit-config) to open `khulnasoft.conf`:

```text
[db]
    mode = dbengine
    storage tiers = 3

    # Tier 0, per second data. Set to 0 for no limit.
    dbengine tier 0 retention size = 1GiB
    dbengine tier 0 retention time = 14d

    # Tier 1, per minute data. Set to 0 for no limit.
    dbengine tier 1 retention size = 1GiB
    dbengine tier 1 retention time = 3mo

    # Tier 2, per hour data. Set to 0 for no limit.
    dbengine tier 2 retention size = 1GiB
    dbengine tier 2 retention time = 2y
```

### Legacy configuration

<details><summary>v1.99.0 and prior</summary>

Khulnasoft prior to v2 supports the following configuration options in  `khulnasoft.conf`.
They have the same defaults as the latest v2, but the unit of each value is given in the option name, not at the value.

```text
storage tiers = 3
# Tier 0, per second data. Set to 0 for no limit.
dbengine tier 0 disk space MB = 1024
dbengine tier 0 retention days = 14
# Tier 1, per minute data. Set to 0 for no limit.
dbengine tier 1 disk space MB = 1024
dbengine tier 1 retention days = 90
# Tier 2, per hour data. Set to 0 for no limit.
dbengine tier 2 disk space MB = 1024
dbengine tier 2 retention days = 730
```

</details>

<details><summary>v1.45.6 and prior</summary>

Khulnasoft versions prior to v1.46.0 relied on disk space-based retention.

**Default Retention Limits**:

| Tier |     Resolution      | Size Limit |
|:----:|:-------------------:|:----------:|
|  0   |  high (per second)  |   256 MB   |
|  1   | middle (per minute) |   128 MB   |
|  2   |   low (per hour)    |   64 GiB   |

You can change these limits in `khulnasoft.conf`:

```text
[db]
    mode = dbengine
    storage tiers = 3
    # Tier 0, per second data
    dbengine multihost disk space MB = 256
    # Tier 1, per minute data
    dbengine tier 1 multihost disk space MB = 1024
    # Tier 2, per hour data
    dbengine tier 2 multihost disk space MB = 1024
```

</details>

## Cache sizes

There are two cache sizes that can be configured in `khulnasoft.conf` to better optimize the Database:

1. `[db].dbengine page cache size`: controls the size of the cache that keeps metric data on memory.
2. `[db].dbengine extent cache size`: controls the size of the cache that keeps in memory compressed data blocks.

Both of them are dynamically adjusted to use some of the total memory computed above. The configuration in `khulnasoft.conf` allows providing additional memory to them, increasing their caching efficiency.
