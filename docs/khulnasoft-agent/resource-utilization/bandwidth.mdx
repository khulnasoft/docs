# Bandwidth Requirements

## Production Systems: Standalone Khulnasoft

Standalone Khulnasoft may use network bandwidth under the following conditions:

1. You configured data collection jobs that are fetching data from remote systems. There are no such jobs enabled by default.
2. You use the dashboard of the Khulnasoft.
3. [Khulnasoft Cloud communication](#khulnasoft-cloud-communication) (see below).

## Metrics Centralization Points: Between Khulnasoft Children & Parents

Khulnasoft supports multiple compression algorithms for streaming communication. Khulnasoft Children offer all their compression algorithms when connecting to a Khulnasoft Parent, and the Khulnasoft Parent decides which one to use based on algorithm availability and user configuration.

| Algorithm |                                                              Best for                                                               |
|:---------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|  `zstd`   |                      The best balance between CPU utilization and compression efficiency. This is the default.                      |
|   `lz4`   |                   The fastest of the algorithms. Use this when CPU utilization is more important than bandwidth.                    |
|  `gzip`   | The best compression efficiency, at the expense of CPU utilization. Use this when bandwidth is more important than CPU utilization. |
| `brotli`  |                                  The most CPU intensive algorithm, providing the best compression.                                  |

The expected bandwidth consumption using `zstd` for 1 million samples per second is 84 Mbps, or 10.5 MiB/s.

The order compression algorithms is selected is configured in `stream.conf`, per `[API KEY]`, like this:

```text
    compression algorithms order = zstd lz4 brotli gzip
```

The first available algorithm on both the Khulnasoft Child and the Khulnasoft Parent, from left to right, is chosen.

Compression can also be disabled in `stream.conf` at either Khulnasoft Children or Khulnasoft Parents.

## Khulnasoft Cloud Communication

When Khulnasoft Agents connect to Khulnasoft Cloud, they communicate metadata of the metrics being collected, but they do not stream the samples collected for each metric.

The information transferred to Khulnasoft Cloud is:

1. Information and **metadata about the system itself**, like its hostname, architecture, virtualization technologies used and generally labels associated with the system.
2. Information about the **running data collection plugins, modules and jobs**.
3. Information about the **metrics available and their retention**.
4. Information about the **configured alerts and their transitions**.

This is not a constant stream of information. Khulnasoft Agents update Khulnasoft Cloud only about status changes on all the above (e.g., an alert being triggered, or a metric stopped being collected). So, there is an initial handshake and exchange of information when Khulnasoft starts, and then there only updates when required.

Of course, when you view Khulnasoft Cloud dashboards that need to query the database a Khulnasoft Agent maintains, this query is forwarded to an Agent that can satisfy it. This means that Khulnasoft Cloud receives metric samples only when a user is accessing a dashboard and the samples transferred are usually aggregations to allow rendering the dashboards.
