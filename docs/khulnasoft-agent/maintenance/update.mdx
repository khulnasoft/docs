# Update Khulnasoft

The update process can differ based on the installation type:

- Install types starting with `binpkg` or ending with `build` or `static` can be updated using our [kickstart script update method](#unix).
- Installs with an installation type of `custom` usually indicate installing a third-party package through the system package manager. To update these installations, you should update the package just like you would any other package on your system.
- macOS users should check [our update instructions for macOS](#macos).
- Manually built installs should check [our update instructions for manual builds](#manual-installation-from-git).

## Determine which installation method you used

You can run the following to determine your installation type:

```bash
khulnasoft -W buildinfo | grep -E 'Installation Type|Install type:'
```

The following table contains all possible installation types:

| Installation-type  | Description                                                                                                                                                 |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| binpkg-rpm         | RPM-based native packages shipped from Khulnasoft's repos.                                                                                                     |
| binpkg-deb         | DEB-based native packages shipped from Khulnasoft's repos.                                                                                                     |
| kickstart-build    | Build from source with the kickstart script's `--build-only` option.                                                                                        |
| kickstart-static   | Installed the static builds, shipped from khulnasoft via the kickstart script's (option: `--static-only`).                                                     |
| manual-static-ARCH | Manually installed static Agent binaries by downloading archives from GitHub and installing them manually. Offline installations are part of this category. |
| legacy-build       | Used for pre-existing kickstart.sh or khulnasoft-installer.sh installations. This exist because we cannot determine how the install originally happened.       |
| legacy-static      | Same as legacy-build, but for static installs.                                                                                                              |
| oci                | Installed using official Docker images from Khulnasoft, though not necessarily running on Docker                                                               |
| custom             | Anything not covered by the other identifiers, including manual builds, manually running khulnasoft-installer.sh, and third-party packages (community).        |
| Unknown            | Same as custom.                                                                                                                                             |

If you're using an older Khulnasoft version or the above command doesn't output anything, try our one-line installation script in dry-run mode. Run the following command to determine the appropriate update method:

```bash
wget -O /tmp/khulnasoft-kickstart.sh https://get.khulnasoft.com/kickstart.sh && sh /tmp/khulnasoft-kickstart.sh --dry-run
```

> **Note**
>
> if you installed Khulnasoft using an installation prefix, you will need to add an `--install-prefix` option specifying that prefix to make sure it finds the existing installation.

If you see a line starting with `--- Would attempt to update existing installation by running the updater script located at:`, then our [kickstart script update method](#unix) will work for you.

Otherwise, it should either indicate that the installation type is not supported (which probably means you either have a `custom` install or built Khulnasoft manually) or indicate that it would create a new install (which means that you either used a non-standard install path, or that you don’t actually have Khulnasoft installed).

## UNIX

In most cases, you can update Khulnasoft using our one-line kickstart script. This script will automatically
run the update script installed as part of the initial install and preserve the existing installation options you specified.

If you installed Khulnasoft using an installation prefix, you will need to add an `--install-prefix` option specifying that prefix to this command to make sure it finds Khulnasoft.

```bash
wget -O /tmp/khulnasoft-kickstart.sh https://get.khulnasoft.com/kickstart.sh && sh /tmp/khulnasoft-kickstart.sh
```

## Windows

To update Khulnasoft, [download](/docs/khulnasoft-agent/installation/windows#download-the-msi-installer) the latest installer and reinstall the Agent.

## macOS

If you installed Khulnasoft on your macOS system using Homebrew, you can explicitly request an update:

```bash
brew upgrade khulnasoft
```

Homebrew downloads the latest Khulnasoft via the [formula](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/n/khulnasoft.rb), ensures all dependencies are met, and updates Khulnasoft via reinstallation.

## Manual installation from Git

If you installed [Khulnasoft manually from Git](/docs/developer-and-contributor-corner/install-the-khulnasoft-agent-from-a-git-checkout) run our automatic requirements installer, which works on many Linux distributions, to ensure your system has the dependencies necessary for new features.

```bash
bash <(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/khulnasoft/khulnasoft/master/packaging/installer/install-required-packages.sh)
```

Navigate to the directory where you first cloned the Khulnasoft repository, pull the latest source code, and run `khulnasoft-install.sh` again. This process compiles Khulnasoft with the latest source code and updates it via reinstallation.

```bash
cd /path/to/khulnasoft/git
git pull origin master
sudo ./khulnasoft-installer.sh
```

> **Note**
>
> If you installed Khulnasoft with any optional parameters, such as `--install-prefix` to install under a specific directory, you need to set them again during this process.

## Additional info

### Control runtime behavior of the updater script

Starting with v1.40.0, the `khulnasoft-updater.sh` script supports a config file called `khulnasoft-updater.conf`, located in the same directory as the main `khulnasoft.conf` file. This file uses POSIX shell script syntax to define variables that are used by the updater.

This configuration file can be edited using our [`edit-config` script](/docs/khulnasoft-agent/configuration).

The following configuration options are currently supported:

- `KHULNASOFT_UPDATER_JITTER`: Sets an upper limit in seconds on the random delay in the updater script when running as a scheduled task. This random delay helps avoid issues resulting from too many nodes trying to reconnect to the Cloud at the same time. The default value is 3600, which corresponds to one hour. Most users shouldn’t ever need to change this.
- `KHULNASOFT_MAJOR_VERSION_UPDATES`: If set to a value other than 0, then new major versions will be installed without user confirmation. Must be set to a non-zero value for automated updates to install new major versions.
- `KHULNASOFT_NO_SYSTEMD_JOURNAL`: If set to a value other than 0, skip attempting to install the  `khulnasoft-plugin-systemd-journal` package on supported systems on update. The updater will install this optional package by default on supported systems if this option is not set. It only affects systems using native packages.
