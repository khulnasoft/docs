# Backing up a Khulnasoft Agent

> **Note**
>
> Users are responsible for backing up, recovering, and ensuring their data's availability because Khulnasoft stores data locally on each system due to its decentralized architecture.

## Introduction

When planning a Khulnasoft Agent backup, it's essential to recognize the types of data that can be backed up, either individually or collectively:

| Data type           | Description                                          | Location                                                        |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Agent configuration | Files controlling configuration of the Khulnasoft Agent | [config directory](/docs/khulnasoft-agent/configuration) |
| Metrics             | Database files                                       | /var/cache/khulnasoft                                              |
| Identity            | Claim token, API key and some other files            | /var/lib/khulnasoft                                                |

## Scenarios

### Backing up to restore data in case of a node failure

In this standard scenario, you’re backing up your Khulnasoft Agent in case of a node failure or data corruption so that the metrics and the configuration can be recovered. The purpose is not to backup/restore the application itself.

1. Verify that the directory paths in the table above contain the information you expect.

   > **Note**  
   > The specific paths may vary depending on installation method, Operating System, and whether it is a Docker/Kubernetes deployment.

2. It is recommended that you [stop the Khulnasoft Agent](/docs/khulnasoft-agent/maintenance/service-control) when backing up the Metrics/database files.  
   Backing up the Agent configuration and Identity folders is straightforward as they shouldn’t be changing very frequently.

3. Using a backup tool such as `tar` you will need to run the backup as _root_ or as the _khulnasoft_ user to access all the files in the directories.

   ```bash
   sudo tar -cvpzf khulnasoft_backup.tar.gz /etc/khulnasoft/ /var/cache/khulnasoft /var/lib/khulnasoft
   ```

   Stopping the Khulnasoft Agent is typically necessary to back up the database files of the Khulnasoft Agent.

If you want to minimize the gap in metrics caused by stopping the Khulnasoft Agent, consider implementing a backup job or script that follows this sequence:

- Backup the Agent configuration Identity directories
- Stop the Khulnasoft service
- Backup up the database files
- Restart the Khulnasoft Agent.

### Restoring Khulnasoft

1. Ensure that the Khulnasoft Agent is installed and is [stopped](/docs/khulnasoft-agent/maintenance/service-control)

   If you plan to deploy the Agent and restore a backup on top of it, then you might find it helpful to use the [`--dont-start-it`](/docs/khulnasoft-agent/installation/linux#other-options) option upon installation.

   ```bash
   wget -O /tmp/khulnasoft-kickstart.sh https://get.khulnasoft.com/kickstart.sh && sh /tmp/khulnasoft-kickstart.sh --dont-start-it
   ```

   > **Note**
   > If you are going to restore the database files, then you should first ensure that the Metrics directory is empty.
   >
   > ```bash
    > sudo rm -Rf /var/cache/khulnasoft
    > ```

2. Restore the backup from the archive

    ```bash
    sudo tar -xvpzf /path/to/khulnasoft_backup.tar.gz -C /
    ```

3. [Start the Khulnasoft Agent](/docs/khulnasoft-agent/maintenance/service-control)
