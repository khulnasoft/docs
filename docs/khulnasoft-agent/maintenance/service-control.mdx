# Service Control

The Khulnasoft Agent automatically starts at boot after installation.

> In most cases, you need to **restart the Khulnasoft service** to apply changes to configuration files. Health configuration files, which define alerts, are an exception. They can be [reloaded](#reload-health) **without restarting**.
>
> Restarting the Khulnasoft Agent will cause temporary gaps in your collected metrics. This occurs while the khulnasoft process reinitializes its data collectors and database engine.

## UNIX

### Using `systemctl`, `service`, or `init.d`

| Action  | Systemd                         | Non-systemd                    |
|---------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| start   | `sudo systemctl start khulnasoft`  | `sudo service khulnasoft start`   |
| stop    | `sudo systemctl stop khulnasoft`   | `sudo service khulnasoft stop`    |
| restart | `sudo systemctl restart khulnasoft`| `sudo service khulnasoft restart` |

### Using `khulnasoft`

Use the `khulnasoft` command, typically located at `/usr/sbin/khulnasoft`, to start the Khulnasoft daemon.

```bash
sudo khulnasoft
```

If you start the daemon this way, close it with `sudo killall khulnasoft`.

### Using `khulnasoftcli`

The Khulnasoft Agent also comes with a [CLI tool](/docs/khulnasoft-agent/agent-cli) capable of performing shutdowns. Start the Agent back up using your preferred method listed above.

```bash
sudo khulnasoftcli shutdown-agent
```

### Reload health

No need to restart the Khulnasoft Agent after modifying health configuration files (alerts). Use `khulnasoftcli` to avoid metric collection gaps.

```bash
sudo khulnasoftcli reload-health
```

## Windows

> **Note**
>
> You will need to run PowerShell as administrator.

- To **start** Khulnasoft, run `Start-Service Khulnasoft`.
- To **stop** Khulnasoft, run `Stop-Service Khulnasoft`.
- To **restart** Khulnasoft, run `Restart-Service Khulnasoft`.

If you prefer to manage the Agent through the GUI, you can start-stop and restart the `Khulnasoft` service from the "Services" tab of Task Manager.
