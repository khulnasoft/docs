# Replication of Past Samples

Replication is triggered when a Khulnasoft Child connects to a Khulnasoft Parent. It replicates the latest samples of collected metrics a Khulnasoft Parent may be missing. The goal of replication is to back-fill samples that were collected between disconnects and reconnects, so that the Khulnasoft Parent does not have gaps on the charts for the time Khulnasoft Children were disconnected.

The same replication mechanism is used between Khulnasoft Parents (the sending Khulnasoft is treated as a Child and the receiving Khulnasoft as a Parent).

## Replication Limitations

The current implementation is optimized to replicate small durations and have minimal impact during reconnecting. As a result, it has the following limitations:

1. Replication can only append samples to metrics. Only missing samples at the end of each time-series are replicated.

2. Only `tier0` samples are replicated. Samples of higher tiers in Khulnasoft are derived from `tier0` samples, and therefore there is no mechanism for ingesting them directly. This means that the maximum retention that can be replicated across Khulnasoft is limited by the samples available in `tier0` of the sending Khulnasoft.

3. Only samples of metrics that are currently being collected are replicated. Archived metrics (or even archived nodes) will be replicated when and if they are collected again. Khulnasoft archives metrics 1 hour after they stop being collected, so Khulnasoft Parents may miss data only if Khulnasoft Children are disconnected for more than an hour from their Parents.

When multiple Khulnasoft Parents are available, the replication happens in sequence, like in the following diagram.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Child-->>Parent1: Connect
    Parent1-->>Child: OK
    Parent1-->>Parent2: Connect
    Parent2-->>Parent1: OK
    Child-->>Parent1: Metric M1 with retention up to Now
    Parent1-->>Child: M1 stopped at -60sec, replicate up to Now
    Child-->>Parent1: replicate M1 samples -60sec to Now
    Child-->>Parent1: streaming M1
    Parent1-->>Parent2: Metric M1 with retention up to Now
    Parent2-->>Parent1: M1 stopped at -63sec, replicate up to Now
    Parent1-->>Parent2: replicate M1 samples -63sec to Now
    Parent1-->>Parent2: streaming M1
```

As shown in the diagram:

1. All connections are established immediately after a Khulnasoft child connects to any of the Khulnasoft Parents.
2. Each pair of connections (Child->Parent1, Parent1->Parent2) complete replication on the receiving side and then initiate replication on the sending side.
3. Replication pushes data up to Now, and the sending side immediately enters streaming mode, without leaving any gaps on the samples of the receiving side.
4. On every pair of connections, replication negotiates the retention of the receiving party to back-fill as much data as necessary.

## Configuration options for Replication

The following `khulnasoft.conf` configuration parameters affect replication.

On the receiving side (Khulnasoft Parent):

- `[db].replication period` limits the maximum time to be replicated. The default is 1 day. Keep in mind that replication is also limited by the `tier0` retention the sending side has.

On the sending side (Khulnasoft Children, or Khulnasoft Parent when parents are clustered):

- `[db].replication threads` controls how many concurrent threads will be replicating metrics. The default is 1. Usually the performance is about two million samples per second per thread, so increasing this number may allow replication to progress faster between Khulnasoft Parents.

- `[db].cleanup obsolete charts after` controls for how much time after metrics stop being collected will not be available for replication. The default is 1 hour (3600 seconds). If you plan to have scheduled maintenance on Khulnasoft Parents of more than 1 hour, we recommend increasing this setting. Keep in mind, however, that increasing this duration in highly ephemeral environments can have an impact on RAM utilization, since metrics will be considered as collected for longer durations.

## Monitoring Replication Progress

Inbound and outbound replication progress is reported at the dashboard using the Khulnasoft Function `Streaming`, under the `Top` tab.

The same information is exposed via the API endpoint `http://agent-ip:19999/api/v2/node_instances` of both Khulnasoft Parents and Children.
