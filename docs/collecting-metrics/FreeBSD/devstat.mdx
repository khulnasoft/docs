# devstat


<img src="https://khulnasoft.com/img/hard-drive.svg" width="150"/>


Plugin: freebsd.plugin
Module: devstat

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/maintained%20by-Khulnasoft-%2300ab44" />

## Overview

Collect information per hard disk available on host.

The plugin calls `sysctl` function to collect necessary data.

This collector is supported on all platforms.

This collector supports collecting metrics from multiple instances of this integration, including remote instances.


### Default Behavior

#### Auto-Detection

This integration doesn't support auto-detection.

#### Limits

The default configuration for this integration does not impose any limits on data collection.

#### Performance Impact

The default configuration for this integration is not expected to impose a significant performance impact on the system.


## Metrics

Metrics grouped by *scope*.

The scope defines the instance that the metric belongs to. An instance is uniquely identified by a set of labels.



### Per devstat instance

These metrics give a general vision about I/O events on disks.

This scope has no labels.

Metrics:

| Metric | Dimensions | Unit |
|:------|:----------|:----|
| system.io | io, out | KiB/s |

### Per disk



This scope has no labels.

Metrics:

| Metric | Dimensions | Unit |
|:------|:----------|:----|
| disk.io | reads, writes, frees | KiB/s |
| disk.ops | reads, writes, other, frees | operations/s |
| disk.qops | operations | operations |
| disk.util | utilization | % of time working |
| disk.iotime | reads, writes, other, frees | milliseconds/s |
| disk.await | reads, writes, other, frees | milliseconds/operation |
| disk.avgsz | reads, writes, frees | KiB/operation |
| disk.svctm | svctm | milliseconds/operation |



## Alerts


The following alerts are available:

| Alert name  | On metric | Description |
|:------------|:----------|:------------|
| [ 10min_disk_utilization ](https://github.com/khulnasoft/khulnasoft/blob/master/src/health/health.d/disks.conf) | disk.util | average percentage of time ${label:device} disk was busy over the last 10 minutes |


## Setup

### Prerequisites

No action required.

### Configuration

#### File

The configuration file name for this integration is `khulnasoft.conf`.
Configuration for this specific integration is located in the `[plugin:freebsd:kern.devstat]` section within that file.

The file format is a modified INI syntax. The general structure is:

```ini
[section1]
    option1 = some value
    option2 = some other value

[section2]
    option3 = some third value
```
You can edit the configuration file using the [`edit-config`](/docs/khulnasoft-agent/configuration#edit-a-configuration-file-using-edit-config) script from the
Khulnasoft [config directory](/docs/khulnasoft-agent/configuration#the-khulnasoft-config-directory).

```bash
cd /etc/khulnasoft 2>/dev/null || cd /opt/khulnasoft/etc/khulnasoft
sudo ./edit-config khulnasoft.conf
```
