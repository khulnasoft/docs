# Supervisor


<img src="https://khulnasoft.com/img/supervisord.png" width="150"/>


Plugin: go.d.plugin
Module: supervisord

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/maintained%20by-Khulnasoft-%2300ab44" />

## Overview

This collector monitors Supervisor instances.

It can collect metrics from:

- [unix socket](http://supervisord.org/configuration.html?highlight=unix_http_server#unix-http-server-section-values)
- [internal http server](http://supervisord.org/configuration.html?highlight=unix_http_server#inet-http-server-section-settings)

Used methods:

- [`supervisor.getAllProcessInfo`](http://supervisord.org/api.html#supervisor.rpcinterface.SupervisorNamespaceRPCInterface.getAllProcessInfo)




This collector is supported on all platforms.

This collector supports collecting metrics from multiple instances of this integration, including remote instances.


### Default Behavior

#### Auto-Detection

This integration doesn't support auto-detection.

#### Limits

The default configuration for this integration does not impose any limits on data collection.

#### Performance Impact

The default configuration for this integration is not expected to impose a significant performance impact on the system.


## Metrics

Metrics grouped by *scope*.

The scope defines the instance that the metric belongs to. An instance is uniquely identified by a set of labels.



### Per Supervisor instance

These metrics refer to the entire monitored application.

This scope has no labels.

Metrics:

| Metric | Dimensions | Unit |
|:------|:----------|:----|
| supervisord.summary_processes | running, non-running | processes |

### Per process group

These metrics refer to the process group.

This scope has no labels.

Metrics:

| Metric | Dimensions | Unit |
|:------|:----------|:----|
| supervisord.processes | running, non-running | processes |
| supervisord.process_state_code | a dimension per process | code |
| supervisord.process_exit_status | a dimension per process | exit status |
| supervisord.process_uptime | a dimension per process | seconds |
| supervisord.process_downtime | a dimension per process | seconds |



## Alerts

There are no alerts configured by default for this integration.


## Setup

### Prerequisites

No action required.

### Configuration

#### File

The configuration file name for this integration is `go.d/supervisord.conf`.


You can edit the configuration file using the [`edit-config`](/docs/khulnasoft-agent/configuration#edit-a-configuration-file-using-edit-config) script from the
Khulnasoft [config directory](/docs/khulnasoft-agent/configuration#the-khulnasoft-config-directory).

```bash
cd /etc/khulnasoft 2>/dev/null || cd /opt/khulnasoft/etc/khulnasoft
sudo ./edit-config go.d/supervisord.conf
```
#### Options

The following options can be defined globally: update_every, autodetection_retry.


<details open><summary>Config options</summary>

| Name | Description | Default | Required |
|:----|:-----------|:-------|:--------:|
| update_every | Data collection frequency. | 1 | no |
| autodetection_retry | Recheck interval in seconds. Zero means no recheck will be scheduled. | 0 | no |
| url | Server URL. | http://127.0.0.1:9001/RPC2 | yes |
| timeout | System bus requests timeout. | 1 | no |

##### Multi-instance

> **Note**: When you define multiple jobs, their names must be unique.

Collect metrics from local and remote instances.

## Troubleshooting

### Debug Mode

**Important**: Debug mode is not supported for data collection jobs created via the UI using the Dyncfg feature.

To troubleshoot issues with the `supervisord` collector, run the `go.d.plugin` with the debug option enabled. The output
should give you clues as to why the collector isn't working.

- Navigate to the `plugins.d` directory, usually at `/usr/libexec/khulnasoft/plugins.d/`. If that's not the case on
  your system, open `khulnasoft.conf` and look for the `plugins` setting under `[directories]`.

  ```bash
  cd /usr/libexec/khulnasoft/plugins.d/
  ```

- Switch to the `khulnasoft` user.

  ```bash
  sudo -u khulnasoft -s
  ```

- Run the `go.d.plugin` to debug the collector:

  ```bash
  ./go.d.plugin -d -m supervisord
  ```

### Getting Logs

If you're encountering problems with the `supervisord` collector, follow these steps to retrieve logs and identify potential issues:

- **Run the command** specific to your system (systemd, non-systemd, or Docker container).
- **Examine the output** for any warnings or error messages that might indicate issues.  These messages should provide clues about the root cause of the problem.

#### System with systemd

Use the following command to view logs generated since the last Khulnasoft service restart:

```bash
journalctl _SYSTEMD_INVOCATION_ID="$(systemctl show --value --property=InvocationID khulnasoft)" --namespace=khulnasoft --grep supervisord
```

#### System without systemd

Locate the collector log file, typically at `/var/log/khulnasoft/collector.log`, and use `grep` to filter for collector's name:

```bash
grep supervisord /var/log/khulnasoft/collector.log
```

**Note**: This method shows logs from all restarts. Focus on the **latest entries** for troubleshooting current issues.

#### Docker Container

If your Khulnasoft runs in a Docker container named "khulnasoft" (replace if different), use this command:

```bash
docker logs khulnasoft 2>&1 | grep supervisord
```
